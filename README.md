# Unsupervised-Machine-Learning-for-Customer-Segmentation

In this project, I trained an unsupervised machine learning algorithm to perform bank customer segmentation.
This project could be practically applied at any marketing department in the banking and retail industries to segment customers into 'clusters' or 'groups'. 
In this project I went through the following tasks: 
1. Understand the problem statement and business case, 
2. Import libraries and datasets, 
3. Visualize and explore datasets, 
4. Understand the theory and intuition behind k-means clustering machine learning algorithm, 
5. Learn how to obtain the optimal number of clusters using the elbow method, 
6. Use Scikit-Learn library to find the optimal number of clusters using elbow method, 
7. Apply k-means using Scikit-Learn to perform customer segmentation, 
8. Apply Principal Component Analysis (PCA) technique to perform dimensionality reduction and data visualization.


I've learned how to:
1. Understand how to leverage the power of machine learning to transform marketing departments and perform customer segmentation
2. Apply Python libraries to import and visualize dataset images.
3. Understand the theory and intuition behind k-means clustering machine learning algorithm
4. Learn how to obtain the optimal number of clusters using the elbow method
5. Apply Scikit-Learn library to find the optimal number of clusters using elbow method
6. Apply k-means in Scikit-Learn to perform customer segmentation
7. Understand the theory and intuition behind Principal Component Analysis (PCA) algorithm
8. Compile and fit unsupervised machine learning models such as PCA and K-Means to training data
9. Apply Principal Component Analysis (PCA) technique to perform dimensionality reduction and data visualization
